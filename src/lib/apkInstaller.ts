/**
 * Fetching the new build and handing it to Android's installer, in-app.
 *
 * What this replaces: a link that threw the shop out into a browser, left an
 * APK sitting in Downloads forever, and relied on somebody finding it in a
 * file manager and tapping the right one. On NG POS, where this was built
 * first, most of the "the update didn't work" calls turned out to be somebody
 * installing last month's APK — three of them were still in the folder.
 *
 * What it cannot do is install silently. Android will always draw its own
 * confirmation over the top of this, and the first time it will also insist
 * the user allows installs from Specskart POS. A truly unattended install needs the
 * handset to be enrolled as a managed device; short of that, "auto" here means
 * the fetching, the housekeeping and the version bookkeeping are automatic and
 * exactly one deliberate tap is left to the person holding the phone.
 *
 * Two things Android does give us for free, and they are the reason this is
 * safe to do at all:
 *
 *  - **The install is an upgrade, not a second copy.** Same package name, so
 *    the old version is replaced in place and the SQLite till data, the queued
 *    offline sales and the SecureStore keys all survive.
 *  - **The signature has to match.** A tampered or substituted APK cannot
 *    install over ours, whatever the download served. That is a stronger
 *    guarantee than a checksum we would be verifying against a number fetched
 *    over the same connection.

 * the sum so a till is told up front rather than filling its last free
 * megabytes and failing at the point of no return — but not so high that a
 * phone with room to spare is refused.
 *
 * Retune this if the APK grows. It is roughly 4x the download, which is the

 *

 * a network with no working IPv6 route: the attempt blackholes until something
 * gives up, then IPv4 succeeds and the transfer runs at full speed. Whatever the
 * cause, the cure is the same and it is not patience — a fresh connection
